# 2024 Endorsement Coding Details

Endorsement scores for the three 2024 out-of-sample Republican Senate primaries, coded using the same 6/3/2/1 weighting scheme as the 2008–2022 training data (Governor = 6, Senator = 3, Representative = 2, state/party official = 1, Trump = 6).

## Ohio (March 19, 2024)

**Bernie Moreno (Score: 13):** Trump (6) + Sen. JD Vance, OH (3) + Rep. Jim Jordan, OH (2) + Rep. Max Miller, OH (2). Trump endorsed December 2023 via Truth Social.

**Matt Dolan (Score: 9):** Gov. Mike DeWine, OH (6) + former Sen. Rob Portman, OH (3, retired January 2023, within 10-year window). Both endorsed early March 2024.

**Frank LaRose (Score: 0):** No qualifying endorsements from elected officials. Campaign supported by Uihlein-funded Leadership for Ohio Fund super PAC, but PAC spending is not captured in the endorsement variable.

## West Virginia (May 14, 2024)

**Jim Justice (Score: 12):** Trump (6) + Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, WV (3) + Sen. Mitch McConnell (3, recruited Justice to run). Trump endorsed October 2023.

**Alex Mooney (Score: 0):** Club for Growth PAC and Senate Conservatives Fund provided financial support but no qualifying endorsements from sitting elected officials identified.

## Arizona (July 30, 2024)

**Kari Lake (Score: 15):** Trump (6) + Sen. JD Vance (3, out-of-state) + approximately 3 AZ U.S. Representatives including Biggs, Gosar, Crane (6). Lake received endorsements from 20+ Republican senators for the general election; only pre-primary endorsements from key figures are counted here to avoid extrapolating beyond the training data range (max = 19).

**Mark Lamb (Score: 0):** No qualifying endorsements from elected officials. Lamb ran as an alternative Trump-style candidate without institutional backing.

## Fundraising Sources

Ohio figures from pre-primary FEC filings (January–February 2024, filed March 7). West Virginia from Q1 2024 FEC quarterly report. Arizona from Q1 2024 FEC filing. All figures include self-funding contributions, consistent with training data methodology (e.g., McCormick 2022 included $11.3M with substantial self-funding).
